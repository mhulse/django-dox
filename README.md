# Django Dox

### Yet another Django flat pages app on steroids.

The built-in flat pages app of Django is cool, but it does have its limitations. This app is based on [Django's flat pages app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/flatpages/), but its got a bunch more (useful) fields and a few other goodies.

This is app perfect for managing template shells and for quick prototyping.

Tested and working with Djago 1.3.
